# Learning Thoughts

- The word idiomatic keeps popping up, I don't know what that means in the current context

- vars have a default zero value that's only declared, every type has its own zero value

- literals can be 
    - ints, 
    - floats, 
    - rune (chars): only have to be in single quotes, can be used to represent ocatl, hex, UNicode, escape characters
    - string: zero or more rune literals, double quotes, cannot have double quotes, backslashes and newlines that are unescaped
    - literals are untyped in Go, meaning they can interact with compatible vars
    - there's a default type for literals

- built-in data types
    - bool: ```true``` or ```false```

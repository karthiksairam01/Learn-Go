# Composite Types

## Arrays

- rarely used directly (apparently)
- ```var x [3]int``` creates array of 3 ints, all init to 0
- ```var x = [3]int{10, 20, 30}``` is an array literal
- If you ahve a sparse array and only want to populate certain indices then specify their indices like ```var x = [12]int{1, 5: 4, 6, 10:100, 15}``` this works like a pointer-based framework
- you don't have to specify the array size if you are initializing an array literal like this ```var x = [...]int{10, 20}```
- arrays can be compared 
- you can make 2D arrays ```var x [2][3]int``` means array of length 2, whose elements are of type array of ints of length 3. Go does not support matrices
- read and write to/from array by normal bracket notation ```x[0] = 10``` 
- no negative indices (like Python), 
- len() takes array and returns size

### Biggest drawback of arrays

> Go considers size of the array to be part of the type of the array
>
> Hence [3]int and [4]int are different types, not the same *array* type as you might think
>
> Hence cant use variable to specify size of array, because types are resolved at compiletime
>
> There's no option to change all of them to identical types, hence you can't write functions that works with array of any size. (WHA- ?) 

- Hence, dont use arrays unless specified. But why this limitation? Because arrays are a backbone for **slices** 

## Slices

- When you think of using an array in any other lang, use slice in Go. Basically, for a sequence of vals
- Obviously, length is not a part of the type for a slice
- we can grow them, iterate through them etc normally
- You **don't** specify the size for a slice when you declare them such as ```var x = []int{10,20,30}```. The subtle difference is that ```[...]``` is an array and ```[]``` is a slice. Hence. the above is a slice literal.
- Same rules apply for specifying sparse and multidimensional slices, reading and writing from a slice; as an array.
- ```var x []int``` is an empty slices initialized to the value ```nil```, that is its zero value. nil represents lack of value, has no type 
- slices cannot be compared, you can only compare a slice with nil, nothing else. not another slice, not an int etc.
- len() works for slices too, returns its length

### append()

- takes 2 params, slice and value(s). slice type and value type must be same
- it returns a slice of that type, hence needs to be initalized to a variable. 
- remember to always initalize, otherwise compile-time error ðŸ˜„ It's because go uses call-by-value, which means it makes a copy every time something is passed as a parameter, hence after making the copy it needs to reassign it to a var right? that's why it always needs to initialized

```
var x []int
x = append(x, 10)

var x = []int{1,2,3,4}
x = append(x,5)

x = append(x, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```

- you can also append another slice to a slice, first you need to unroll it using ```...``` like 

```
y := []int{1,2,3}
x = append(x, y...)
```

### cap(), the Capacity in go

- cap function allows you to see the capacity of a slice. it means how much you can append until the compiler actually copies all your old slice data, renames it and gives it more space. old slice is garbage collected. not used much, but good to know that there exists a cap in memory for slices, its not infinite (obviously)

```
cap(x)
```

### make()

- If you do know the size of a slice beforehand, its better to use ```make()``` because there is an overhead that comes with automtically growing the slice by appending.

- this is also the only way to initialize a slice that has a fixed size to it (remember from slices introduction that the syntax should not have the size, otherwise it becomes an array declaration)

```
p := make([]int, 10)
```

- note that length and capacity are set to the number that you give in make(), this means that the slice is not empty, its initialized to its null value, which is 0 for all int literals

- Hence, **don't append** to make() slices, because they are not empty slices. 

- **But**, make() also takes one param in the middle for its initial length. If you make that 0, then it means your slice is empty, has capacity 10. You **can** append to this safely.

```
x := make([]int, 0, 10)
```
